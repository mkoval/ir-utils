This is a collection of Python scripts used to gather, plot, and interpret sensor data. All testing done on these scripts uses the PIC18 Vex Microcontroller connected to a *nix computer via the official Vex USB-to-Serial Adapter. That being said, there is no reasons these scripts are designed to be data-source agnostic and as cross-platform as possible.

All data is expected to be in a CSV-like file format with white-space (i.e. spaces or tabs) delimiters between columns and UNIX end-lines (\n) between rows. The only exception to this rule is the auxiliary data file required by liveinterp.py, which expects commas instead of whitespace as the delimiters between columns.

These utility scripts are intended to be chained together using pipes. For example, the follow line plots the current distance reading of the sensor in centimeters:

./ir-nlines.py /dev/cu.PL2303-00001004 all \
| ./liveaverage.py mean 10 2 \
| ./liveinterp.py IRCurve.txt 2 \
| ./liveplot.py -n500 --min 0 --max 150 1 2

See the individual scripts for more information.
